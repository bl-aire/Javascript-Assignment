            The last time I was in contact with Quadratic Equation was during my WAEC. I studied a paramedic course and had nothing to do with Mathematics for years. To solve the problem, I studied to understand how Quadratic Equation works again. And on studying, I came to the conclusion that my Javascript code had to:
            <ul>
                <li>Accept arguements/ have arguements passed into it so I can test the equation. Hence the use of a Function with the variables a, b and c passed into it.</li>
                <li>Make provision for two results to fit the +- operation after b<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>Make provision for when the discriminant(equation under the square root) is 0, less than 0 or greater than 0. And for this, I used conditional statements.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
